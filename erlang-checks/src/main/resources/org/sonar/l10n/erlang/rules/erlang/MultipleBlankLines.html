<p>
  For better readability try to avoid too many blank lines.
  You can set up the threshold for inside and outside of the functions.
  The comments handled as code lines.
</p>
<p>
  By default the settings are:
<ul>
  <li>at most 2 blank-lines between functions</li>
  <li>at most 1 blank-line inside a function body</li>
</ul>
<pre>
  -module(a).



  -export([hello/0]). %% issue, too many blank lines


  hello()->
    Code,


    Code, %% issue, too many blank lines

     %comment

    DifferentBlock, %% not an issue, the comment does no matter


    %comment

    Whatever1, %% issue, too many blank lines before the comment

    %comment


    Whatever2. %% issue, too many blank lines after the comment
  </pre>
