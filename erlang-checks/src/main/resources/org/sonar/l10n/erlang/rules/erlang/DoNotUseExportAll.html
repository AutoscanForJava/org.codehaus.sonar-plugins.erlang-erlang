<p>Never use -compile(export_all) for several reasons:<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Clarity: it's easier to see which functions are intended to be used outside the module.</li>
  <li>Code smell: you get warnings for unused functions.</li>
  <li>Optimization: the compiler might be able to make more aggressive optimizations knowing that
    not all functions have to be exported.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
