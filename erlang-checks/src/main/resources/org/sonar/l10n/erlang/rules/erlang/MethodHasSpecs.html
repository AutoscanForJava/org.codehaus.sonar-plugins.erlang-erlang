<p>All method should define specs. In the specsType property you
  can define what is the supported specs declaration:
<ul>
  <li>ATTRIBUTE means only -spec is allowed</li>
  <li>COMMENT means only %% @spec format is allowed</li>
  <li>BOTH means any of the previous ones are allowed</li>
</ul>
</p>
